				<h2 >Talk 1: Hardware/Software Co-Exploration of Neural Architectures</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">We propose a novel hardware and software co-exploration framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS). Different from existing hardware-aware NAS which assumes a fixed hardware design and explores the NAS space only, our framework simultaneously explores both the architecture search space and the hardware design space to identify the best neural architecture and hardware pairs that maximize both test accuracy and hardware efficiency. Such a practice greatly opens up the design freedom and pushes forward the Pareto frontier between hardware efficiency and test accuracy for better design tradeoffs. The framework iteratively performs a twolevel (fast and slow) exploration. Without lengthy training, the fast exploration can effectively fine-tune hyperparameters and prune inferior architectures in terms of hardware specifications, which significantly accelerates the NAS process. Then, the slow exploration trains candidates on a validation set and updates a controller using the reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy together with the hardware efficiency. In this article, we demonstrate that the co-exploration framework can effectively expand the search space to incorporate models with high accuracy, and we theoretically show that the proposed two-level optimization can efficiently prune inferior solutions to better explore the search space. The experimental results on ImageNet show that the co-exploration NAS can find solutions with the same accuracy, 35.24% higher throughput, 54.05% higher energy efficiency, compared with the hardware-aware NAS.</p>

					<h6>DREAMPlace: Deep Learning Toolkit-Enabled GPU Acceleration for Modern VLSI Placement</h6>
					<p>Placement for very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is one of the most important steps for design closure. We propose a novel GPU-accelerated placement framework DREAMPlace, by casting the analytical placement problem equivalently to training a neural network. Implemented on top of a widely adopted deep learning toolkit PyTorch, with customized key kernels for wirelength and density computations, DREAMPlace can achieve around 40Ã— speedup in global placement without quality degradation compared to the state-of-the-art multithreaded placer RePlAce. We believe this work shall open up new directions for revisiting classical EDA problems with advancements in AI hardware and software.</p>

						<h6>Gemmini: Enabling Systematic Deep-Learning Architecture Evaluation via Full-Stack Integration</h6>
						<p>DNN accelerators are often developed and evaluated in isolation without considering the cross-stack, system-level effects in real-world environments. This makes it difficult to appreciate the impact of Systemon-Chip (SoC) resource contention, OS overheads, and programming-stack inefficiencies on overall performance/energy-efficiency. To address this challenge, we present Gemmini, an open-source, full-stack DNN accelerator generator. Gemmini generates a wide design-space of efficient ASIC accelerators from a flexible architectural template, together with flexible programming stacks and full SoCs with shared resources that capture system-level effects. Gemmini-generated accelerators have also been fabricated, delivering up to three orders-of-magnitude speedups over high-performance CPUs on various DNN benchmarks.</p>

					<h6>BOOM-Explorer: RISC-V BOOM Microarchitecture Design Space Exploration Framework</h6>
					<p>The microarchitecture design of a processor has been increasingly difficult due to the large design space and time-consuming verification flow. Previously, researchers rely on prior knowledge and cycle-accurate simulators to analyze the performance of different microarchitecture designs but lack sufficient discussions on methodologies to strike a good balance between power and performance. This work proposes an automatic framework to explore microarchitecture designs of the RISCV Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM), termed as BOOM-Explorer, achieving a good trade-off on power and performance. Firstly, the framework utilizes an advanced microarchitecture-aware active learning (MicroAL) algorithm to generate a diverse and representative initial design set. Secondly, a Gaussian process model with deep kernel learning functions (DKL-GP) is built to characterize the design space. Thirdly, correlated multi-objective Bayesian optimization is leveraged to explore Pareto-optimal designs. Experimental results show that BOOM-Explorer can search for designs that dominate previous arts and designs developed by senior engineers in terms of power and performance within a much shorter time.</p>

					<h6>A GPU-accelerated Deep Stereo-LiDAR Fusion for Real-time High-precision Dense Depth Sensing</h6>
					<p>Active LiDAR and stereo vision are the most commonly used depth sensing techniques in autonomous vehicles. Each of them alone has weaknesses in terms of density and reliability and thus cannot perform well on all practical scenarios. Recent works use deep neural networks (DNNs) to exploit their complementary properties, achieving a superior depth-sensing. However, these state-of-the-art solutions are not satisfactory on real-time responsiveness due to the high computational complexities of DNNs. In this paper, we present FastFusion, a fast deep stereo-LiDAR fusion framework for real-time high-precision depth estimation. FastFusion provides an efficient two-stage fusion strategy that leverages binary neural network to integrate stereoLiDAR information as input and use cross-based LiDAR trust aggregation to further fuse the sparse LiDAR measurements in the back-end of stereo matching. More importantly, we present a GPU-based acceleration framework for providing a low latency implementation of FastFusion, gaining both accuracy improvement and real-time responsiveness. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of FastFusion, which obtains a significant speedup over state-of-the-art baselines while achieving comparable accuracy on depth sensing.</p>

					<h6>TreeNet: Deep Point Cloud Embedding for Routing Tree Construction</h6>
					<p>In the routing tree construction, both wirelength (WL) and pathlength (PL) are of importance. Among all methods, PD-II and SALT are the two most prominent ones. However, neither PD-II nor SALT always dominates the other one in terms of both WL and PL for all nets. In addition, estimating the best parameters for both algorithms is still an open problem. In this paper, we model the pins of a net as point cloud and formalize a set of special properties of such point cloud. Considering these properties, we propose a novel deep neural net architecture, TreeNet, to obtain the embedding of the point cloud. Based on the obtained cloud embedding, an adaptive workflow is designed for the routing tree construction. Experimental results show that the proposed TreeNet is superior to other mainstream models for the point cloud on classification tasks. Moreover, the proposed adaptive workflow for the routing tree construction outperforms SALT and PD-II in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

					<h6>Intermittent-Aware Neural Architecture Search</h6>
					<p>The increasing paradigm shift towards intermittent computing has made it possible to intermittently execute deep neural network (DNN) inference on edge devices powered by ambient energy. Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have achieved great success in automatically finding DNNs with high accuracy and low inference latency on the deployed hardware. We make a key observation, where NAS attempts to improve inference latency by primarily maximizing data reuse, but the derived solutions when deployed on intermittently-powered systems may be inefficient, such that the inference may not satisfy an end-to-end latency requirement and, more seriously, they may be unsafe given an insufficient energy budget.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:2em">This work proposes iNAS, which introduces intermittent execution behavior into NAS to find accurate network architectures with corresponding execution designs, which can safely and efficiently execute under intermittent power. An intermittent-aware execution design explorer is presented, which finds the right balance between data reuse and the costs related to intermittent inference, and incorporates a preservation design search space into NAS, while ensuring the power-cycle energy budget is not exceeded. To assess an intermittent execution design, an intermittent-aware abstract performance model is presented, which formulates the key costs related to progress preservation and recovery during intermittent inference. We implement iNAS on top of an existing NAS framework and evaluate their respective solutions found for various datasets, energy budgets and latency requirements, on a Texas Instruments device. Compared to those NAS solutions that can safely complete the inference, the iNAS solutions reduce the intermittent inference latency by 60% on average while achieving comparable accuracy, with an average 7% increase in search overhead.</p>

					<h6>APOLLO: An Automated Power Modeling Framework for Runtime Power Introspection in High-Volume Commercial Microprocessors</h6>
					<p>Accurate power modeling is crucial for energy-efficient CPU design and runtime management. An ideal power modeling framework needs to be accurate yet fast, achieve high temporal resolution (ideally cycle-accurate) yet with low runtime computational overheads, and easily extensible to diverse designs through automation. Simultaneously satisfying such conflicting objectives is challenging and largely unattained despite significant prior research.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:2em">In this paper, we propose APOLLO, an automated per-cycle power modeling framework that serves as the basis for both a design-time power estimator and a low-overhead runtime on-chip power meter (OPM). APOLLO uses the minimax concave penalty (MCP)-based feature selection algorithm to automatically select less than 0.05% of RTL signals as power proxies. The power estimation achieves R 2 > 0.95 on Arm Neoverse N1 [3] and R 2 > 0.94 on Arm Cortex-A77 [2] microprocessors, respectively. When integrated with an emulator-assisted flow, APOLLO finishes per-cycle power estimation on millions-of-cycles benchmark in minutes for million-gate industrial CPU designs. Furthermore, the power model is synthesized and integrated into the microprocessor implementation as a runtime OPM. APOLLOâ€™s accuracy further improves when coarse-grained temporal resolution is preferred. To our best knowledge, this is the first runtime OPM that simultaneously achieves per-cycle temporal resolution and < 1% area/power overhead without compromising accuracy, which is validated on high-performance, out-of-order industrial CPU designs.</p>
